Learn the Dart programming language to build cross-platform (Mobile, Web &amp; Desktop) Apps with Flutter!

## What ?

Dart is an open-source general-purpose programming language. It is originally developed by Google and later approved as a standard by ECMA.</br>
Dart is a new programming language meant for the server as well as the browser. Introduced by Google, the Dart SDK ships with its compiler – the Dart VM.</br>
The SDK also includes a utility -dart2js, a transpiler that generates JavaScript equivalent of a Dart Script.</br> 
Is an object-oriented language with C-style syntax which can optionally trans compile into JavaScript. It supports a varied range of programming aids like interfaces, classes, collections, generics, and optional typing.


## Who ?

This tutorial will be quite helpful for all those developers who want to develop single-page web applications using Dart. It is meant for programmers with a strong hold on object-oriented concepts.

## Why use Dart ?

### Pros And Cons:

Pros Include:
- Familiar language
- Built-in package manager
- Compiles to JavaScript
- Dart runs on the server, with bundles for http server, web sockets, files, directories, and more
- Full reflection API (mirrors)


Cons Include:
- Not as mature as Java
- Not as many packages as Node.js

## Dart Syntax:

Syntax defines a set of rules for writing programs. Every language specification defines its own syntax. 
A Dart program is composed of −

- Variables and Operators
- Classes
- Functions
- Expressions and Programming Constructs
- Decision Making and Looping Constructs
- Comments
- Libraries and Packages

## Object-Oriented Programming in Dart

Dart is an Object-Oriented language. Object Orientation is a software development paradigm that follows real-world modelling. Object Orientation considers a program as a collection of objects that communicate with each other via mechanism called methods.


- Object
- State
- Behavior
- Identity
- Class
- Method

## Dart VS Javascript:

Dart:

- More trust-worthy as it’s backed by Google
- Runs twice the speed of JavaScript
- Quite scalable across projects
- Like Java
- Used extensively for the Flutter mobile UI framework

Javascript:

- Can be used on both front-end and back-end
- Used everywhere!
- Comes with lots of great and popular frameworks
- Fast, light-weight and flexible
- Can’t run a device which doesn’t use JavaScript today
